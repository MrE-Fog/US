# Introduction

This repo is for organized edits made by Lyft OSM team to OpenStreetMap.

## OSM at Lyft



## Who we are

We are a small team of trained OSM editors located in Seattle, WA. 

## What are we working on

Lyft OSM team does not participate in bulk editing or importing data created by AI algorithms. Instead we have been focusing on improving the OSM map manually in the areas that can improve the rideshare experience currently and in the future.
