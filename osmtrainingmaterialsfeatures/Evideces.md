#### We have 3 kinds of data that we consider proprietary now owned by Lyft:
- **“proprietary telemetry data"** – Lyft drivers GPS tracks 
- **“proprietary streetlevel imagery”** - photos collected by cameras installed in our drivers' vehicles. This data is updated frequently. Photos are not older than a year, and sometimes even a month. 
- **"proprietary aerial imagery"** – As for now it is ***Nearmap*** imagery. They do allow us to use their imagery for OSM edits by license."
