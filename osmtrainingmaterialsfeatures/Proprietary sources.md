#### We have 3 kinds of data that owned by Lyft::
- **“Lyft telemetry data"** – Lyft drivers GPS tracks 
- **“Lyft-owned street-level imagery”** - photos collected by cameras installed in our drivers' vehicles. This data is updated frequently. Photos are not older than a year, and sometimes even a month. 
- **"Lyft-owned aerial imagery"** – As for now it is ***Nearmap*** imagery. They do allow us to use their imagery for OSM edits by license.
